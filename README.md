# how to use it
open up the file and put in your skillport username, password, and the course you wanna take where it says
\
this only works in chrome and windows and probably wont work the first time
\
you'll also have to install [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
## hotkeys
- CtrlShift-A open up a new skillport incognito window and put in your username and password
- Ctrl-Shift-S - navigate to the course you want to take and open up the menu
- Ctrl-Shift-D - skip through the whole course
- Ctrl-Shift-Z - take screenshot and go to next question (in the test portion)
- Ctrl-Shift-L - Do Ctrl-Shift-Z 10 times
